The way it should probably be done

Just rings. No fancy strobes
Nice smooth transitions. Use stretched sine waves or something
Use multiple layers
  a pattern of fine periodic medium-speed subtle rings for texture. Maybe 2way. Maybe periodic
  A few fat slow rings
  Occasional fast mediumish rings
  
Thus a nice composition

TODO

figure out if our ring thicknesses are working
get sound working
