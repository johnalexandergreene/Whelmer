CELLS TO SOUNDS
 
 A NEW LOGIC

for each cell
create a sound piece
average all soundpieces

for each cell
  frequency=color (or delta, or whatever)
  amplitude=distance from 0.5. That is, the area of max volume is the equidistant ring

this might be a hog


@@@@@@@@@@@
---SEEING AS HOW
IT IS RADIALLY SYMMETRIC
How about we address only a single strip of cells? A 1d array extending from center-out
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@


WE COULD MIX THIS WITH THE OLD LOGIC@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ 

(the old logic being sound based on ring size and location)

we could mix the sound. used both
because the rings certainly do sound nice.

#####################################




a sound logic
  outer radius = frequency
  thickness = volume
  
also fuzz it a bit

-------------

also, try visual noise
  random gray and alpha on everything inside the circle, or something  


-----------------

checked the ring radius. Works fine.

The way it should probably be done

Just rings. No fancy strobes
Nice smooth transitions. Use stretched sine waves or something
Use multiple layers
  a pattern of fine periodic medium-speed subtle rings for texture. Maybe 2way. Maybe periodic
  A few fat slow rings
  Occasional fast mediumish rings
  
Thus a nice composition

TODO

figure out if our ring thicknesses are working
get sound working
