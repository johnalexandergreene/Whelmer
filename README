WHELMER

whelmer is like clouded plain except round

just circles, .. rings... of different colors, arising from the center
moving at different speeds
fading away when they get too far from the center, when they get near the edge
(SHOULD WE HAVE 2-WAY RING MOVEMENT?)

interacting via overlap
  which manifests as color blend

the field is black
so we can work with a square. because the edges will be hidden

and the whole field of pixel-squares is then interpreted as sound
or maybe we'll interpret the circles that way
I'm not sure.

1) make the field. the black square
2) make a fuzzy circle
3) make it move, arise ... fade in and then fade out
  maybe different rates of fade

ring differences
  color
  thickness
  speed
  rate of fade, outer and inner edge
  part of a sequence.
    what we'll have is a list full of rings
    each ring has a birthday
    we increment through time at 60 ticks per second
    when a we hit a ring's birthday it manifests in the center
      and at every subsequent tick it moves outward, 
      eventually disappearing from view and being removed from the list
    rings who's birthday has not been hit just hang out in the list waiting to be born
      thus we can create patterns, sequences or whatever. 
      Probably in reverse, starting at NOW-1 and adding a new ring at every 100 ticks into the past for 100 ticks or whatever.
